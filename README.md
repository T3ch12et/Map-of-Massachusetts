# Map of Massachusetts
A reference map depicting the state of Massachusetts, capturing its geographical and key administrative features in a compact format.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ArcGIS Pro

I downloaded the dataset of Masachusetts data and selected the Counties_norteast layer that was mvoed to the bottom of the Contents pane then opened the Symbology pane from the Feature Layer tab. The goal is to showcase one feature in the map, which the state of Massachusetts. In the Symbology pane I selected the Unique Values which shows the different values regarding the different state names. From Field 1 I chose STATE_NAME and selected every state except Massachusetts and removed them. Massachusetts is now highlighted with a unique symbol to distinguish it from the other states, which are all drawn with the symbol defined for "all other values."



## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
